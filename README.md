# DSC207R-PythonProjects-Fall2024
This repository consists of the guided solo project assignments from the UCSD DSC207R course. 

For the mini project, we were provided with a dataset with the goal to go through the data science process using the tools and techniques learned from the first half of the quarter such as Pandas, Numpy, visualizations, and ethics. 

For the final project, we were instructed to research and identify a dataset of our choice with the goal to build our own end-to-end analysis using Python, emphasizing what we learned for the whole quarter using numpy, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn and scikitlearn libraries.
